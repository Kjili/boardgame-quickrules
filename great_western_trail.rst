Important glossary
------------------

place
  | a cardboard tile on the board (building, hazard tile or teepee)
  | empty spaces on the board are not considered places

worker
  | cowboy, craftsman or engineer
  | **the same worker(s) cannot be used twice in the same turn**

forest
  | a building is located in a forest if it covers any part of one of the forests drawn on the map

Important general rules
-----------------------

discard
  | every card you gain goes onto your discard (cow or objective)
  | you can look through your discard any time

objective
  | draw from the four public ones or from pile, put onto your discard and refill the public ones to four
  | any number of them can be played from your hand (before or after Phase A and B of your turn), then trigger their immediate action
  | played cards have to be fulfilled at the end of the game to get points, else cost points
  | cards not played can be played at the end of the game before scoring
  | **resources are not shared between cards** (if two cards require 1 teepee, you need 2 teepees to fulfill both)
  | resources are shared between objective cards and station master tile goals

locomotive movement
  | move 1-max spaces, max is given by the action
  | **a space blocked by another player's locomotive cannot be accessed, it is not counted for movement** (i.e. if another locomotive is in front of yours, moving one space will put yours in front of theirs)
  | if moving backward, you cannot move less spaces than indicated (requirement for a reward)

upgrade a train station
  | if your locomotive ends its movement in front of a train station (next to turnout spaces), you have the chance to upgrade it
  | upgrading: pay the cost, put your marker on it
  | if there is a station master tile, you can replace it with one of your workers (any kind, rightmost tile) to gain the station master tile
  | you cannot upgrade a station that already has your marker (thus you cannot take the station master tile later)
  | after arriving at and optionally upgrading the last train station (space 39), you have to move your locomotive 1-x spaces backwards (x is any space of your choice, even another train station that you may upgrade immediately), also gain 3 dollars

teepee trade
  | if you gain a teepee you either gain or pay money as indicated on the map

hands
  | if there is a black and/or green hand on the place you move to, pay the fee to the player who owns the building or the bank (hazard tile or teepee)
  | if you cannot pay (everything), pay as much as you can and continue normally

actions
  | many actions have a requirement (often marked with a red arrow, e.g. to drop a card) and a reward (often marked with a green arrow)
  | the requirement needs to be fulfilled, a reward can be skipped or partly skipped unless it is money
  | a + combines rewards

simple help action
  | do an action once, not twice! (if you have removed the corresponding marker on the left of your player board)
  | can be done on any place instead of local actions

double help action
  | do an action once or twice (if you have removed the corresponding marker(s) on the left of your player board)

hire
  | you **must not hire workers from the row of the current job market token**
  | costs as much as the row + modifier on the action
  | fill up your player space from left to right, choose to activate or ignore actions (even if these actions were activated before by a worker that has been removed)
  | you have one worker by default (printed)

cattle market
  | you can use your cowboys to buy cattle or add 2 cows to the market
  | you can only buy the cattle in the market (face-up cards)
  | cows are put on your discard pile

remove hazard tile
  | put a hazard tile from the map next to your player board and pay the price (if any is indicated)

build
  | place on an empty space or upgrade one of your buildings to a higher-level one (old one is removed from the game)
  | you pay costs for each craftsman required and you can only build if you have enough craftsman
  | an upgrade requires less craftsman (and thereby money), i.e. the difference in required craftsman (if one building requires 1 and you upgrade to one that requires 3, you only need 2 craftsman)
  | buildings are identical for all players

job market token
  | moved downward one row once a worker is placed onto it
  | blocks hiring in current row
  | if moved along yellow arrow: cattel market refills to 7/10/13 cards (2/3/4) players
  | if moved along red arrow: ends the game once moved out of job market (player who moves it out gets it)

Gameplay
--------

first round
  | **place your workers on any neutral building along the track and continue with Phase B**

turns (you must do all phases)
  1. Phase A
  
     | move your cattleman
  2. Phase B
  
     | either use the local action of the building you arrived at (if neutral or your own)
     | or use a simple help action (anywhere except Kansas City)
     | or do all actions in Kansas City
  3. Phase C
  
     | draw cards up to your hand limit (indicated on your player board)

cattleman movement (Phase A)
  | move 1-max steps, max is indicated on your board
  | **moving to the next place on the board (building, hazard tile or teepee) takes 1 step** (empty spaces do not count as steps)
  | move along the track to Kansas City (not backwards)
  | movement may cost you (see hands)
  | freely choose where to move on junctions
  | movement ends in Kansas City
  | multiple players can be in the same place

local actions
  | perform multiple non-exclusive actions in any order
  | you do not have to perform all actions
  | if an action is drawn next to the building tile on the gameboard, it becomes part of the local actions (risk actions)

Kansas City
  1. choose one of the 1, 2 and then 3 tiles in the forecasts and put them in the corresponding place
  
     | teepee: lowest-value teepee space (remove from game if it can't be placed)
     | hazard tile: lowest-value hazard space (remove from game if it can't be placed)
     | worker: into the row of the current job market token from left (number players) to right (token moves once replaced with a worker)
  2. get money for your cattle, discard hand
  
     | x = sum(set(cow values in hand)), i.e. sum of values for each differing cow in your hand
     | x = x + temporary and permanent certificates
     | reduce the temporary certificate counter by the used amount
     | get x money
  3. transport the cattle to a town, pay the transport costs
  
     | deliver to a town in a distance smaller or equal to x that does not have your marker on it (Kansas City and San Francisco can have multiple of your markers)
     | pay 1 money for each cross ahead of your locomotive up to the town position
     | put a marker from your player board onto the town (white bordered ones on any town, black bordered ones only on black bordered towns only)
     | pay costs to remove the marker from your player board, if applicable
     | do the town action, if applicable
  4. put your cattleman on the beginning of the track
  5. refill the 1, 2 and 3 tile forecasts

Game End
--------

game end
  | once the job market token is moved out of the job market (player who moves it out gets it), this was their last turn
  | all other players have one final turn

score
  | 5 money is worth 1 point, all else is indicated
  | station master tile resources are independent from objective card goal resources (if an objective cards needs two teepees and a station master tile gives points for two teepees, both count)

win
  | player(s) with the most points win(s)
