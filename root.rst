Important glossary
------------------

Buildings
  square tokens that can only be placed in the square spaces in the clearings

Tokens
  round tokens that can be placed anywhere on a clearing (any amount of them)

Rule
  player with most warriors and buildings (not tokens) rules a clearing
  ties imply there is no ruler
  Vagabond never rules a clearing

Suit
  the non-player faction of a clearing or card (fox, mouse or rabbit)
  birds are wild and match any suit
  cards can be used for their suit marked on the upper left corner of the card to trigger effects


Important general rules
-----------------------

Turn
  initial turn order and starting player is random (only faction setup order is not)
  each player plays their three phases (Birdsong, Daylight, Evening), then the next player follows

Craft
  cards can be crafted when the requirements on the bottom left of the card are met (e.g. by owning a piece on the clearings with matching suits on the map, see factions for further detail)
  each piece activated for crafting can be activated only once per round!
  if you craft an item, take it from the supply (if an item is not available in the supply the card cannot be crafted!)
  immediate effect cards are played and discarded (light yellow background)
  permanent effect cards stick with the player (light blue-grey background), only one of the same name are allowed per player

Move
  only from or to a clearing which you rule (following the paths on the map)
  any amount of pawns > 0 can be moved at once

Battle
  initiating player chooses defender among factions in the clearing
  multiple battle rounds need to be initiated as new battles
  defender can play ambush cards matching the clearing's suit -> 2 immediate hits
  attacker can react with an ambush card matching the clearing's suit -> no ambush
  attacker gets the higher roll, defender the lower
  min(warriors present, rolled hits) are taken on each side
  extra hits are not limited by, i.e. are independent of, the number of warriors present in the clearing
  defenseless clearings (no warriors present) give 1 extra hit to the attacker
  warriors are always removed before buildings/tokens
  tokens and buildings need to be attacked, the affected players decide which building/token they remove when hit
  each player scores 1 point for each removed enemy token or building (also outside battle)!

Dominance cards
  in play for 3+ players
  can be played for their suit but are not discarded, instead made available to other players (put face-up next to the board)
  available cards can be picked up (in hand) in Daylight by spending a card of matching suit
  can be activated only when owning >= 10 victory points
  can be activated in Daylight (played from hand) -> put it down face-up before you and change the winning strategy (points won't make you win any more)
  activated dominance cards cannot be removed from play or be replaced -> change of winning strategy is permanent

Items
  can only be used by the Vagabond
  can be crafted for points by anyone if available
  if removed, are removed from the game permanently

Simultaneous Effects
  if ambiguous, current player decides

Cards
  hand cards are face-down for other players, number of hand cards is known
  cannot be traded (unless stated otherwise)
  discard pile can be inspected any time and is reshuffled if the draw pile is empty
  birds are wild, i.e. jokers for all other suits

Forests
  adjacent to all clearings without crossing a path (rivers do not count as paths)
  adjacent to all forests reached by crossing one path

Placing Buildings/Tokens
  take from the leftmost, return to rightmost slot

Setup
  choose faction
  place score marker
  draw 3 cards
  place ruins (if two vagabonds: use both sets of "R" items and place two in each ruin)
  form item supply
  set up factions in order (if two vagabond: randomly decide which one goes first)

Win
  first player to reach 30 points or fulfil his played out dominance card

Factions
--------

Faction rules always overrule general rules.
If it says for actions "take in any number and order", this is still restricted by your maximum possible actions and special action restrictions like "once per turn" on your faction board.

Marquise de Cat (reach 10)
  *industrial and military power, strong presence everywhere, fixed set of actions*
  general rules:
    you craft with your workshops, activating one workshop gives you its clearing's suit for crafting, workshops cannot be activated more than once
    you may take up to 3 actions from a given set of possible ones (take in any number and order), bird cards can grant extra actions
    you get card bonus on your recruit building track
    you score mainly through buildings
    good card crafts: Better Burrow Bank, Cobbler, Command Warren
  special rules that may be unclear:
    Field Hospitals can be used for multiple warriors (for a single payment)
    your Keep does not count as a building
    the Keep prevents other players from placing pieces in its clearing, but they can be moved there
    move: your two moves can be independent or you can gather/split forces in between or move with the same force twice
    build: the clearing you choose to build in needs to be connected by a route of clearings ruled by you to the correct number of wood tokens (again, in a clearing ruled by you)
  Strategy:
    bunny cards are good for you, consider placing your keep in any of the top two corners (but won't give you adjacency to two same faction clearings)
    start by building, overworking and building again (two recruits or one recruit, one workshop)
    next, build a recruit or sawmill, get your cats in position for defense
    use bird cards for extra actions (except for bird ambush)
    do not build too many sawmills, especially not in the same clearing
    build recruiters to increase control of the board
    avoid crafting for points early
    craft cards for more actions
    carefully consider when to go into combat, rather block your enemies and defend
    bird dominance can be rather easy for you
    protect your lumbermills!
    protect your Keep, to be able to use Field Hospitals
    you will loose territory, maybe draw back your cats in the beginning to protect your buildings
  Strategy Against:
    strike at lumbermills
    destroy the keep if possible

Eyrie Dynasties (reach 7)
  *start small but aim at expansion, ever-increasing decree determines actions that need to be taken else Turmoil*
  general rules:
    you craft with your roosts, activating one roost gives you its clearing's suit for crafting, roosts cannot be activated more than once (remember your disdain)
    you must take one according action per card in your decree columns (columns determine order of action types, cards within columns have no order) or fall into Turmoil
    you get card bonus on your roost building track
    you score automatically once per round for your roosts on the map
    good card crafts: Tax Collectors, Sappers, Brutal Tactics (pair with Commander), Scouting Party
  special rules that may be unclear:
    each column of your decree may hold any number of cards
    you must resolve each card in each column of your decree but the cards in each column can be resolved in any order
    Turmoil happens immediately when you cannot resolve an action in your decree
    recruit: place a warrior in any clearing with a roost whose suit matches the card
    if there is no leader left after Turmoil, recover all of them
  Strategy:
    the suits of your cards are important for you
    starting leader depends on your cards
      if you have two cards of your current clearing: start Charismatic with two cards in, trigger Turmoil, pick Despot next
      if you have a bird card and a card of your current clearing: start Charismatic (pick fights)
      else: start with Despot (fast growth, aggressive playstyle)
    second leader:
      choose Commander to defend and push advantage
      choose Builder to recover troops (if you lost them) and craft
      choose Despot if you turmoiled very easy or a lot of your roosts have been destroyed
    do not put more than two cards in recruit with the Charismatic leader
    keep to your decree as long as possible but be aware that you will be in Turmoil eventually (try to avoid more than 2-3)
    plan ahead for Turmoil (balance points gained and lost, try to Turmoil in your build phase and do everything else)
    the Charismatic leader makes it easy to pick fights, be careful with the other ones
    have one of each type of clearing and defend them heavily (and maybe a backup of each)
    place bird cards in recruit (or if not possible use your starting clearing's suit, as it's usually the best defended)
    place at least one bird card in battle early in the game - later, other suits can go here
    place only bird cards in build and do not place many here - this is your hardest to fulfil
    place your other cards in move and move your birds back and forth if necessary - this is your easiest to fulfil
    sometimes it makes sense to retreat and let your opponents destroy a roost to safe your decree
    try to avoid loosing cards
    you have the potential to have more actions than other factions, consider placing two cards in your decree every turn
  Eyrie vs Woodland Alliance - destroy their sympathy with Despot, but do not move into clearings of which you own cards!, invoke martial law (have three warriors in adjacent clearings to theirs)
  Strategy Against:
    force Turmoil (especially effective early in the game), unless they are aiming for that
    take out the roosts
    Woodland Alliance is a strong enemy to the Eyrie

Woodland Alliance (reach 3)
  *works through suits mostly, gains sympathy and supporters, no warriors on the map until base is constructed*
  general rules:
    you craft with your sympathy, activating one sympathy token gives you its clearing's suit for crafting, sympathy cannot be activated more than once
    you may take actions by spending supporters (take in any number and order) or by using your officer count (the latter only once you have a base, take in any number and order)
    you get card bonus on your base building track
    you score mainly by placing sympathy tokens
    good card crafts: Armorers, Tax Collectors, Better Burrow Bank, Stand and Deliver, Scouting Cards, Codebreakers
  special rules that may be unclear:
    supporter stack:
      face-down stack of cards (Woodland Alliance player can look at the cards any time)
      supporters can only be spend for their suit and do not count towards hand size
      the stack size is unlimited if any base is present on the map
    Outrage includes bird cards
    a sympathetic clearing is one with sympathy tokens, others are unsympathetic clearings
    revolt can only be used if a base can be placed
    revolt scores points for removed tokens and buildings as in normal battle
    if there are no sympathetic clearings, you can spread sympathy to any, else it needs to be adjacent to a sympathetic clearing
    no clearing can have more than one sympathy token
    craft items to stay friends with the Vagabond
  Strategy:
    early game (1-10 points): spread sympathy, place it in spaces with most connections/movements
    first round: spread sympathy three times in central, high-traffic areas
    first round: mobilize all your cards into your support deck, unless you can craft something extraordinarily good
    build first base up fast (second turn)
    get your second base down immediately afterwards in an adjacent clearing
    get three officers quickly
    cards are valuable for you, craft cards that give you cards and improve battle
    disrupt opponents
    mid game: dig in, do not loose too many pieces
    craft cards (also to lure the Vagabond)
    good combo with 3 officers: move, organize to spread sympathy, recruit back for defense
    get more officers (4-5)
    don't build 3 bases, defend your bases!
    late game: craft cards to get points
    try to stay under the radar
    revolt for your third base only if you can win on this turn
    you can turn warriors into sympathy and earn a lot of points in one round once you have pieces on the board
  Alliance vs Vagabond: Vagabond ignores your sympathy token effect and can make you an enemy for extra points, also his crossbow ignores your Guerilla Warfare
  Strategy Against:
    trigger Martial Law to make spreading sympathy more expensive
    put lots of warriors in clearings with Alliance bases
    destroy Alliance bases
    prevent Alliance from spreading (do not necessarily attack them)
    unite against the Alliance
    if Alliance has many officers but few supporters, leave sympathy in place, else take sympathy out

Vagabond (reach 5, second Vagabond reach 2)
  *makes allies and enemies among players (helping, trading, fighting), fulfils his quests, takes actions based on items, has only one figure that cannot die*
  general rules:
    you craft with your hammers, all of your hammers match your current clearing's suit, you cannot craft multi-suit cards
    you may take actions by exhausting the items in your satchel (take in any number and order)
    you get card bonus through coin items in your coin track
    you score mainly by improving relationships, battling and questing
    good card crafts: Bake Sale, Brutal Tactics, Sappers, Armorers, Scouting Party
  special rules that may be unclear:
    you never rule a clearing nor can you stop others from ruling
    you have no warriors and are no warrior (you cannot use whatever would require these and you are not affected by warrior targeting, e.g. Alliance sympathy tokens)
    you can slip into an adjacent forest (also from a forest into an adjacent forest) and slip or move out of a forest to an adjacent clearing
    slip ignores all effects preventing movement, including the Corvid's snare, and ignores the extra cost of hostile clearings
    removing the last item from a ruin removes the ruin
    quest suits need to match your clearing
    exhausting the torch allows you to take the action on your character card
    items:
      exhausting an item flips it face down (and moves it from its track to the satchel), refreshing it flips it face up, damaging it puts it in the damaged slot, repairing it puts it in the satchel or its track
      teapots, coins and bags are put face up in their respective item tracks when gained, they are not exhausted
      face-up, undamaged items can be freely moved from item track to satchel and back
      all other items are put face up into the satchel when gained
      the damaged item box is part of your satchel
      items removed because your satchel is full leave the game permanently
      exhausting one hammer repairs one item
    battle:
      your maximum hits are capped by your undamaged swords (exhausted or not does not matter) plus all present allied warriors you want to battle with (if any)
      for every hit taken you need to damage an item or remove an allied warrior (check hostility for the latter!)
      you are defenseless if you have no undamaged sword
    relationships:
      aiding a hostile player does not improve relationships (but you can aid them to take items)
      aiding players cannot be stacked, you'll need a total of six cards to get an ally
      moving with or attacking with an ally only works as part of your own pawn's movement/attack
      sacrificing more allied warriors than damaging items in a fight makes your ally hostile at the end of the battle
      else, removing a warrior of a non-hostile player immediately makes this player hostile (this warrior does not yet yield the extra point)
    coalition (with 4+ players):
      you can activate a dominance card and coalition with the player with the least VP (Vagabond chooses if tied), placing your score marker on their board (only of that player has not activated a dominance card yet)
      if that player wins, you win
      the chosen player still plays toward 30 points but may also play their own dominance cards (all you do with the dominance card is remove your own scoring and win with that player)
      if you choose a hostile player, put the relation marker back to indifferent
    if two Vagabond in play:
      you can choose the first item explored in a ruin and explore again to take both if they are different but each of you can only own one "R" item of a certain type
      quests are shared (either Vagabond can complete any of the three)
    exploring without taking an item does not give a VP but exhausts the torch anyway
  Strategy (general):
    be aware of the map and other faction boards each turn, use opportunities for points
    pick starting clearing based on ruin path, getting to each faction quickly if they craft but be non-aggressive with Tinker, stay away from factions that profit from more building space like Marquise
    sometimes it may be beneficial to leave ruins on the board
    get a second teapot quickly
    get ruins early but if a player has an item you really need, get this first
    refresh torch early game
    avoid spending nights in a forest (you can play a game without ever doing so), instead get a hammer and be careful with fights (avoid high casualties)
    only give aid for items
    do not be friendly with everyone (get those building destroyed points and do not waste your weapons), do not be enemy with everyone (get those aid points)
    getting an ally is neat but hard, you will need heavy card draw
    do not break tea pots, bags may be a good choice, depending on your satchel size and amount of items, next boots may be fine or coins, try not to damage weapons, damage exhausted items first!
    use the quests when you have nothing else to do or it is convenient, or start quests early to allow for high-VP quests later
    do not give away bird cards, give away item cards others may want to craft
    play style: tinkerer (friendly play, only one who can craft favor cards), ranger (aggressive play), thief (stealth, balanced)
    additional Vagabonds:
      arbiter (strongest start for fighting, choose enemy faction quickly, stick to clearings with likely fights)
      vagrant (alliances and disruption)
      scoundrel (disruption, high mobility)
  Strategy (friendly):
    aid weak players and those that don't attack you
    get coins early to get cards to aid other players
    have at least two friends
    get points in late game by raiding other players' infrastructure
  Strategy (aggressive):
    choose weapons from the start, crossbows are very helpful for fights
    have at least one friend
    get points by destructing infrastructure
  Ranger vs Marquise is hard, as you need extra boots for every clearing
  Revolts from Alliance and Bombs from Corvids hurt you a lot, because they damage your items
  Strategy Against:
    strike Tinker early
    avoid ruin clearings if you do not want to fight the Ranger
    attack Vagabonds that come close to being your ally
    avoid crafting items the Vagabond needs (like the bag), e.g. craft coins
    attack the Vagabond when he gets to 20 points

Lizard Cult (reach 2)
  *seeks followers and executed rituals to gain power, heavily restricted in movement and battle except for radicalized fighters*
  general rules:
    you craft with your gardens in outcast suits only!, activating one garden gives you its clearing's suit for crafting, gardens cannot be activated more than once, you cannot craft multi-suit cards
    you may take actions by revealing cards from your hand or discarding them (rituals, take in any number and order) or by spending acolytes during Birdsong (conspiracies, take in any number and order)
    you get card bonus on your garden building track (one per suit)
    you score mainly by building gardens and performing a scoring ritual there
    good card crafts: Command Warren, Cobbler, Better Burrow Bank, Stand and Deliver, Royal Claim
  special rules that may be unclear:
    Pilgrim overrides the Eyrie's Lord of the Forest
    outcasts/lost souls:
      you collect ALL player's discarded and spent cards in your lost souls, including Dominance cards and your own cards
      every player can check your lost souls any time
      if suits tie for outcast, the current outcast stays outcast and becomes hated
      once you discard your Lost Souls to the discard pile, the Dominance cards become available
    cards revealed cannot be reused during that turn and acolytes spent go back to the Lizard supply
    place cards you revealed in front of you
    convert and sanctify need to be completed (you need to be able to place a warrior/garden of matching suit to do them)
    you can recruit in any matching clearing (no further restriction)
  Strategy:
    cards are your power, keep a large hand, consider having at least 5 in your hand before you spend any
    have different suits in your hand to stay flexible
    start building gardens and scoring early on (score them fast) and make sure to not fall behind, try to score every turn
    defend your gardens
    build 2-3 gardens of each suit (you can already get far with two stable gardens of two factions each)
    focus your gardens, i.e. try to build two in one clearing
    craft cards that give you cards and/or more actions
    spread quickly and hamper other player's movements to get players to fight you, so you get acolytes by the dead defenders
    promise players to not convert their pieces if they discard to your benefit
    use sanctify only for key buildings, maximizing damage
    aim for hated outcast as much as possible
    craft cards for points in late game
    manage your cards for actions and your discards (for few players) for outcast actions
    dominance is a viable option for you
    use conspiracies (only) with hated outcast
    slow and annoy your opponents, you're slow to win
  Lizard vs Eyrie - you may want to trigger their Turmoil when it gives you a good outcast
  Lizard vs Alliance - destroy their base to get fitting supporters in your lost souls
  Strategy Against:
    discard to prevent hated outcasts
    strike undefended gardens

Riverfolk Company (reach 5)
  *raise economy, build trade posts, gather funds, defend your treasures and move along the river freely*
  general rules:
    you craft not by clearings but by emptying your trading post spaces and committing warriors from the fund block to these spaces (you have no crafting pieces)
    you may take actions by committing or spending funds (yours and other player's warriors, take in any number and order)
    you get no card bonus (you can commit fund to draw cards)
    you score mainly by placing trade posts and scoring dividends (but you can also craft very easily)
    good card crafts: Cobbler, Command Warren, Better Burrow Bank
  special rules that may be unclear:
    you hand cards are displayed publicly above your faction board
    when you loose a trade post, you do not loose your crafting ability
    score dividends only works for funds, not payments and committed warriors
    committed funds go to the committed box (except for crafting) and spent funds go to their owner's supply
    trade posts can go anywhere where there is no trade posts and any faction rules the clearing of which you have two funds (no further restrictions)
    place yourself in clearing with Marquise's lumbermills, they'll have to pay you for using them, or Alliance, as others will pay you for fighting them
    make your hand cards very expensive when you draw a card you want to keep
    build up troops if noone buys from you
    raid the rivers if you get the opportunity for points
    services:
      players buy services with as many warriors from their supply as the service costs, placing them in your payment box
      the Vagabond pays by exhausting items - for each item they exhaust, the you place one of your warriors in the payment box
      service costs need not be changed in Evening
      hand card: they take one of your hand cards into their hand (this can be bought multiple times)
      riverboats: they can use the river as a path this turn
      mercenaries: during daylight and evening of this turn, the Riverfolk warriors are the paying player's for ruling and battling (not Dominance)
      hits in battle must be split, odd hits go to the paying player's pieces, but buildings and tokens are destroyed after all warriors are dead (including Riverfolk)
      the Vagabond cannot buy Mercenaries
  Strategy:
    remind players to use your services, point out opportunities
    place your initial pieces in spaces along the river, defend these
    price everything at 2 initially, keep things affordable for most of the game
    commit other player's warriors before yours, spend yours
    do not spawn your trading posts quickly (will get you lots of points but then?), try not to have more than 3 and protect them
    get down 1-2 trading posts per suit for crafting if necessary
    make sure you have five cards in hand every turn
    craft for points (the cards that will not be bought by other players), crafting is your strength
    try to store up to 2 warriors of each opponent to get trade posts out easily in late game
    attack players in spaces where you have no trading post to avoid losing funds
    you can leave outskirts trade posts easy to get to win by dividends
    get units in your fund to score points, taking less actions gives you points next round (dividends)
  Strategy Against:
    starve them of resources (everyone needs to participate)
    if there's many units in the fund box, cut them in half by removing a trading post
    if you buy, buy when prices are low

Underground Duchy (reach 8)
  *establish a political system and keep your power among the suits*
  general rules:
    you craft with your buildings (citadels and markets), activating one building gives you its clearing's suit for crafting, buildings cannot be activated more than once
    you may take 2 actions (take in any number and order) plus those of your swayed ministers (take once in any order)
    you get card bonus on your markets building track (and additional warriors to your barrow on your citadels building track)
    you score mainly by swaying ministers, some of which give you victory points each round for tunnels and buildings on the map
    good card crafts: Command Warren, Cobbler, P&E: Eyrie Emigre, Charm Offensive
  special rules that may be unclear:
    you rule the Burrow even with no pieces there
    nobody else can place or move any pieces to your Burrow
    if you have multiple ministers of equal rank, you choose which to return as Price of Failure
    you must have a crown of a matching rank on your faction board in order to sway a minister of that rank
    swayed ministers are placed above your faction board, the crown used to sway it is put on that card
  Strategy:
    defend 2-3 clearings in early game, focus on multi-building clearings to be able to defend better
    get ministers out early (all shires are useful to extend actions)
    start building citadels early
    protect your buildings, as you have to remove your strongest minister for every lost building
    craft cards that give you cards and actions
    raid for points if you have the opportunity
    craft for points
  Strategy Against:
    prevent them from spreading
    destroy their buildings

Corvid Conspiracy (reach 3)
  *subdue the suits with criminal power, fulfil plots and misdirect through careful recruiting to avert exposure*
  general rules:
    you craft with your plot tokens (face up or down ones), activating one plot token gives you its clearing's suit for crafting, plot tokens cannot be activated more than once
    you may take up to 3 actions and an additional by sacrificing card draw (take in any number and order)
    you get card bonus by face-up Extortion plots on the map
    you score mainly by revealing plot tokens (you score more for each)
    good card crafts: Sappers, Stand and Deliver, Favor Cards, P&E: Master Engravers, Coffin Makers, Swap Meet
  special rules that may be unclear:
    plot tokens on your faction board are always face down
    you can inspect your face-down plot tokens on the map or on your faction board any time
    players get a VP by removing your plots through exposure
    Embedded Agents works even if you are defenseless
    you can flip plot tokens any number of times, score one VP also for the newly flipped one, then resolve effect
    Recruit has no restrictions, bird cards let you choose the suit in the clearings of which you place warriors
    you cannot swap one face-up with one face-down token with trick (or vice versa)
    Raid triggers also, if it is removed while face-down (but not through Exposure)
    craft for points
  Strategy:
    keep under the radar
    get snares and extortions down early in safe locations, so they cannot be removed easily
    get raid down early (no need for safe location)
    keep track of plot tokens and in which order to reveal them, as you score points for each open one on the map (reveal bombs last)
    moving with groups of three allows for many options
    put plot tokens into clearings of one faction, so they won't be able to remove them all
    raid for points if you have the opportunity
    defend your plot tokens
  Strategy Against:
    work together to extort or destroy undefended plot tokens before they are revealed
    remove Corvid warriors in critical clearings before they can lay down new plots
    try to guess plots and use Exposure to remove them
