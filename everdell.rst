  she ignores costs when playing cards
  she gains one point per card whenever you have to give her cards (and the cards)
  she gains as many cards into her hand instead of resources when you have to give her those (but no points), discard the resources
  she gains point tokens if you have to give her those
  she ignores all texts on locations and on cards she plays (e.g. she can play copies of uniques), the fool is the only exception (she will play it into your city if she can, else discard it as an action)
  turn:
    1. flip top activity card
    2. Nighweave takes the action for her current season
         if possible: take the first action (left of /)
         else if possible: take the second action (right of /)
         else: do as much of the default action as possible
    no action if: she must play a card but cannot, she must discard a card but has none, she must place a worker but has none or all locations of that type are blocked, she must claim a special event but has already claimed one, she must build a wonder/place an adornment but cannot
    3. if Nightweave is in the Meadow, has no workers left to place and draws a card with a spider, she must immediately prepare for season
