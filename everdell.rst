       5. place the card in your city
       6. resolve the card effect, if any, unless done already by removing a card
       6. resolve triggered effects from other cards in YOUR city, you can determine effect order (no effects are triggered when playing cards in an opponent's city)
  3. prepare for season: if you have no worker left, finish the current season (only for yourself, other players may remain in the season), gather workers and do seasonal actions
       1. bring back all workers that are non-permanent
