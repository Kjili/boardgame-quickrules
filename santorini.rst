2. Play with gods
3. Play with heroes (only 2-player-game)
4. Play hero vs god (beware: heroes are weaker)
5. Play the golden fleece version (only 2-player-game)

In 3-4 player games, some gods are not available (refer to the symbol on the cards).

The Golden Fleece
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are no god or hero powers except one god power that shows a golden fleece on the card.

The first player to place workers places the ram figure, the last player to place workers starts.

Any player with a worker neighboring the ram figure at the start of their turn gains the god power for the rest of their turn.

Prometheus (easy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not move up you may build both before and after moving.

Aphrodite

Ares
^^^^

After your turn, you may remove an unoccupied block (i.e. not dome) neighboring your unmoved worker, removing all tokens on it as well.

Setup: Place your workers first in the positions on the edge of the board.

If you move into a space and an opponent worker is on the next space (in a straight line) remove the opponent's worker from the game.

Chaos
^^^^^

Setup: Shuffle all easy god cards (flower symbol) into a face-down pile. Draw the top one and place it face-up in front of you.

You may force a neighboring opponent in the opposite space behind you (in a straight line) if it is unoccupied before you move.

Chronus
^^^^^^^

You also win once there are five or more complete powers on the board (with dome).

Circe
^^^^^

You steal your opponent's power card until your next turn unless your opponent's workers neighbor each other at the beginning of your turn (your opponent can't use it, you can).

Dionysus
^^^^^^^^

If you complete a tower (with dome) you may take an additional turn with an opponent worker. No player can win during this turn.

Eros
^^^^

Setup: Place your workers anywhere along opposite edges of the board.

You also win if one of your workers moves next to your other worker and both are on level 1 (or on any level, including the ground, in a three-player game).

Hera
^^^^

Opponents cannot win by moving onto a position at the edge of the board.

Heslia
^^^^^^

You may build one additional time but not at the edge of the board.

Hypnus
^^^^^^

If one of your opponent's workers is on a higher level than all of their others at the beginning of your opponent's turn, it cannot move.

Limus
^^^^^

Opponents cannot build blocks on positions neighboring your workers (only domes to complete towers).

Medusa
^^^^^^

If any of your opponent workers occupy lower neighboring spaces at the end of your turn, replace them all with blocks (i.e. not domes) and remove them from the game.

Morpheus
^^^^^^^^

Place a block or dome on your god power card at the start of your turn.

Your worker cannot build as normal. Instead, spend any amount (also zero) of the blocks or domes on your god power card and build that many times.

Note: Any player may exchange the blocks on your card, they only act as currency.

Persephone
^^^^^^^^^^

Your opponents must move up with at least one of their workers.

Poseidon
^^^^^^^^

If your unmoved worker is on the ground level after your turn, you may build up to three times in spaces neighboring that worker.

Selene
^^^^^^

Setup: Place a male and a female worker of your color.

Instead of your normal build, you may build a dome at any level with your female worker, even if your male worker moved.

Triton
^^^^^^

Each time your worker moves to a position at the edge of the board that worker may immediately move again.

Zeus
^^^^

You may build below your worker, forcing them up a level. You do not win by building to level 3 that way.

Acolus
^^^^^^

Setup: Place the wind token beside the board and orient it in any of the 8 directions.

You may change the wind direction after your turn.

No worker can move directly into the wind.

Charybdis
^^^^^^^^^

Setup: Place 2 whirlpool tokens on your god power card.

You may place a whirlpool token from your power card to any unoccupied space on the board after your turn.

When both whirlpool tokens are on the board workers that move onto one nust immediately move through to the other whirlpool token. This move is considered to be a move in the same direction as the previous one.

Whirlpool tokens that are build on or removed are returned to your power card.

Clio
^^^^

Place a coin token on the first 3 blocks you build. Opponents treat these positions as if they contained only a dome.

*Banned VS: Circe, Nemesis*

Europa & Talus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setup: Place the Talus token on your god power card.

You may put your Talus token in an unoccupied space neighboring the worker you moved after your turn.

All players treat the Talus' positions as if they contained only a dome.

Gaea
^^^^

Setup: Put two additional workers of your color on your god card.

When any worker builds a dome you may immediately place a worker from your card onto a ground-level position neighboring the dome.

*Banned VS: Atlas, Circe, Nemesis, Selene*

^^^^^^

Setup: You have 3 workers.

You choose whom of your workers builds regardless of movement.

*Banned VS: Circe, Nemesis*

Hades
^^^^^

Opponent workers cannot move down.

*Banned VS: Pan*

Harpies
^^^^^^^

When an opponent moves they are forced to continue into the same direction until they would have to go **up** or cannot move further.

*Banned VS: Hermes, Triton, Charybdis*

Hecate
^^^^^^

Setup: Take the map and put it behind the shield, hidden from your opponents. Place worker tokens on your map after everyone else, these represent the positions of your workers on the board. Your workers are invisible to your opponents.

You move with your worker tokens on your map and build on the board like everyone else.

If an opponent does an action that would not be legal due to your hidden worker's presence, the action is cancelled and their turn ends.

If possible, use an opponent's power on their behalf to make their turns legal without informing them (e.g. Apollo's position swapping).

*Banned VS: Charon, Circe, Dionysus*

Moerae
^^^^^^

Setup: Take the map and put it behind the shield, hidden from your opponents. Place your fate token on your map to select a hidden 2x2 fate space. You have 3 workers.

You also win instead of your opponent when they attempt to win by moving into one of your fate spaces.

*Banned VS: Circe, Hecate, Nemesis*

Nemesis
^^^^^^^

If there is no opponent worker next to any of yours after your turn you may force an equal amount of their workers to swap positions with all of your workers.

*Banned VS: Aphrodite, Bia, Medusa, Terpsichore, Theseus*

Siren
^^^^^

Setup: Place the arrow token beside the board and orient it in any of the 8 directions of the Siren's song.

You may skip your normal turn to force one or more opponent workers one space in the direction of the Siren's song (to an unoccupied space at any level).

Tartarus
^^^^^^^^

Setup: Place your workers first. Take the map and put it behind the shield, hidden from your opponents. After all opponents placed their workers, place your abyss token on your map on any unoccupied position.

A player whose worker enters the abyss position immediately looses. This overrules all win conditions.

*Banned VS: Bia, Circe, Hecate, Moerae*

Terpsichore
^^^^^^^^^^^

All of your workers must move and then all must build.

*Banned VS: Hypnus, Limus, Tartarus*

Urania
^^^^^^

You treat the game board as if it would wrap around itself for movement and building (e.g. allowing you to move out on one edge and coming back on the opposite one).

*Banned VS: Aphrodite*
